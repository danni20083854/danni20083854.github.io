   <p>Security Measures </p>
<p>Why Security Measures are important: </p>
<p>Implementing security measures in a company is much more than just an administrative formality;
		it’s a process to protect employees, assets, and ensure operational continuity. 
		In a world where risks can originate from various sources, including physical security, cybersecurity, and environmental risks,
		managing security in the corporate world is a complex challenge 
</p>
<p> Common Cyber Security Measures Include: </p>
<p> - Secure Configuration:
<p>-- Such as fixing known weakness or vulnerabilities through patching</p>
	 <p>- Network Security:</p>
	<p>    -- Develops simple policies to counteract any risk through an automated technical response: </p>
	<p> - Malware Prevention: </p>
	<p>    -- Any altercation of information carries with it a degree of risk that malware might be substituted,
		  but can be reduced by developing and implementing appropriate anti-malware tools :</p>
	<p> - Managing identity and Access Management: </p>
	 <p>   -- All users should be provided with an appropriate level of system privileges and rights as per their roles and responsibilities: </p>
	<p> - Removable Media Control: </p>
	 <p>  -- All digital assets should be hardened from all data loss and credential theft : </p>
	<p> - User Education, Awareness, and Training: </p>
	  <p> -- Ensures employees can do their job as well as help to keep the organization secure: </p>
	<p> - Virtual Private Network: </p>
	  <p> -- VPN encrypts web traffic by creating a tunnel between the computer and the network, which hides activities from the Internet Service Provider:</p>
 </p>
 <p>When it comes to VPN’s, the encryption makes the data unreadable without the key. For data-in-transit, there are a few options for encryption. :
<p> 	-Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
		-Secure Shell (SSH) 
		-Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
